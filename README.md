# FAT-Simulation
This project is written in C and it shows how FAT File System handles data around. It consists of 3 essential segments each FAT structure has. 
- **FAT** represented as Linked List,
- **ROOT** represented as Structure, 
- **DATA** represented a file input output.
With little extra things on my own like working with **Time** and ANSI colour codes.
It was a project for professor but it could serve as my personal achievement of understanding more advanced function of C
