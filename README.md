# FAT-Simulation
This project is written in C and it shows how FAT File System handles data around. It consists of 3 essential segments each FAT structure has. FAT represented as Linked List, ROOT represented as Structure, DATA represented a file input output. With little extra things on my own like Time and Decorations.
